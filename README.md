# What is wow factor?
Wow factor is a hidden variable that every pet body has. In the directory root.wad/ObjectData/Pets/, each pet body has it's own file. The higher the body's wow factor(WF) the less likely it is to be returned and the lower the body's WF the more likely it is to be returned. This is relative to both parents in each hatch. For example, if you are hatching a Piggle(WF1) and an Enchanted Armament(WF9) then you willhave a much greater chance to get the Piggle.
